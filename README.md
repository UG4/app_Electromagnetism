# electromagnetism_app #

**UG4-Application** for the Electromagnetism plugin.

This application provides scripts and grids for the computations using the ug4 Electromagnetism plugin. Cf. the description of the plugin for details.

Examples:

* pan.lua - simplified computations of the induction cooking: The conducting disc is heated by the eddy currents induced by the magnetic field of the coil;
* cubeincube.lua - a small conducting cube in an insulating larger one;
* ucube.lua - a unit cube of an insulator, Dirichlet BC for E;
* usquare.lua - a 2d example similar to ucube.lua.
